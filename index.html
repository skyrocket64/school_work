	<p>
	The school I attend is the Miami Valley Career Technology Center, I am currently a Junior taking Game Programming and Web Design. I am proficient in C++
	and the Microsoft Office Suite. I am currently studying HTML5 at school and look forward to designing more websites. On my own time I like to play around
	with diffrent game engines such as Unity, Unreal Engine 4, Cry Engine, and RPG Maker VX Ace. I am not very skilled with the first 3 but have been working
	with the RPG Maker platform for a few years now. Next year I will be expanding my education with Unity.
